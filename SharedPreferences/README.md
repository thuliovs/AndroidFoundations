## Project Overview
The **ANDR_SharedPreferences** project is an Android application developed to demonstrate the use of SharedPreferences for data storage. SharedPreferences allows for the storage of key-value pairs, enabling the persistence of simple data types across user sessions.

## Features
- **Data Persistence**: The application saves user preferences and settings using SharedPreferences, ensuring that data remains consistent even after the app is closed and reopened.

- **User Settings Management**: Users can modify settings within the app, and these preferences are stored and retrieved seamlessly using SharedPreferences.

## Lessons Learned
Developing this project provided valuable insights into:

- **Implementing SharedPreferences**: Understanding how to initialize and use SharedPreferences to store and retrieve data efficiently.

- **Data Storage Best Practices**: Learning the appropriate use cases for SharedPreferences, particularly for storing small amounts of primitive data, and recognizing its limitations compared to other storage options.

### How to Use
- **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/thuliovs/ANDR_SharedPreferences.git

- **Open in Android Studio**: Launch Android Studio and select 'Open an existing project.' Navigate to the cloned repository's directory to open the project.

- **Build and Run**: Build the project and run it on an emulator or physical device to explore the SharedPreferences implementation.
