## Project Overview
The **ANDR_BackgroundServices** project is an Android application I developed to explore the implementation of background services in Android. This project demonstrates how to efficiently run tasks in the background, ensuring a seamless user experience without interrupting the main application workflow.

## Features
- **Foreground Services**: Implemented long-running tasks that continue execution even when the application is minimized or in the background.

- **Periodic Work Execution**: Utilized WorkManager to schedule and execute periodic tasks, ensuring efficient resource management.

- **Notification Integration**: Integrated notifications to keep users informed about ongoing background operations.

## Lessons Learned
Developing this project provided valuable insights into:

- **Android Background Processing**: Understanding the different types of background services, such as foreground services, background tasks, and scheduled jobs.

- **Efficient Task Scheduling**: Learning how to leverage WorkManager to optimize task execution based on constraints such as network availability and battery level.

- **User Awareness through Notifications**: Gaining experience in integrating notifications to provide feedback to users about background processes, ensuring better transparency and engagement.

## How to Use
