## Project Overview
I developed the **ANDR_ScreenLifeCycle** project using Android Studio to deepen my understanding of the Android activity lifecycle. This application demonstrates how activities transition through various states, providing a practical exploration of lifecycle methods.

## Key Features and Learnings
- **Activity Lifecycle Exploration**: I implemented and logged each lifecycle callback method, such as `onCreate()`, ``onStart()``, ``onResume()``, ``onPause()``, ``onStop()``, ``onRestart()``, and ``onDestroy()``. This hands-on approach allowed me to observe the sequence and conditions under which these methods are invoked.

- **State Management**: By simulating configuration changes like screen rotations, I learned how to manage state persistence across activity restarts, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **Resource Optimization**: I practiced releasing resources appropriately in lifecycle methods to prevent memory leaks and enhance application performance.

## Lessons Learned
Completing this project enhanced my proficiency in managing the Android activity lifecycle. I gained practical experience in:

- Implementing lifecycle callback methods to control activity behavior during state transitions.

- Maintaining UI state and data consistency across configuration changes.

- Optimizing resource usage by correctly handling resource allocation and deallocation in appropriate lifecycle stages.

This project has equipped me with the skills to develop robust Android applications that handle lifecycle events effectively, ensuring stability and a positive user experience.
