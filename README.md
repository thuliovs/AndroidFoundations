## Project Overview
The **AndroidFoundations** repository is a collection of small Android projects I developed to experiment with and understand fundamental Android features. Each project focuses on a specific functionality, serving as a learning resource for essential Android development concepts.

## Features
- **UI Components & Layouts**: Explored different layout structures like `ConstraintLayout`, `LinearLayout`, and `RecyclerView` for building responsive user interfaces.

- **Activity & Fragment Lifecycle**: Implemented activity transitions and fragment management to understand lifecycle events.

- **Data Storage & Persistence**: Tested various data storage methods, including `SharedPreferences`, SQLite databases, and internal file storage.

- **Networking & API Calls**: Practiced consuming RESTful APIs using `Retrofit` to fetch and display dynamic data.

- **Sensors & Permissions**: Experimented with device sensors (e.g., accelerometer, GPS) and implemented runtime permission handling.

## Lessons Learned
Working on this repository allowed me to strengthen my knowledge in:

- **Core Android Development**: Gaining hands-on experience with essential Android components and best practices.

- **Modular App Structure**: Understanding how to organize and manage multiple features within an application efficiently.

- **Debugging & Performance Optimization**: Identifying common issues in Android development and applying solutions to improve app performance.
